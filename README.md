Arduino code and electronics related to the Propulsion Spin Caster.

Contains an Arduino sketch that is running on a Arduino Nano along with the schematics for the full control circuit. The spincaster creates fuel grains for the MULE-1 hybrid engine by spinning liquid paraffin wax until it has solidified, leaving a cylindical bore down the center. These software and electronics control the motor by implementing a timer that shuts off the motor when finished and at loss of power to the control system for safety.
